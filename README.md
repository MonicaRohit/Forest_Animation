# Forest_Animation
Animation is a powerful tool to make a website more engaging and interactive. Creating an animation using HTML and CSS is a fun and engaging way to make a website more interactive. I have created an animation using HTML and CSS to depict a deer saving its life from a lion.
Used HTML to create a canvas element where the animation will be displayed. 
Used CSS to define the styles for the canvas element, including its size and position. 
Used CSS to define the styles for the objects in the animation, such as the birds, Running Deer and Lion. 
Used CSS transforms and transitions to make them move and animate.
